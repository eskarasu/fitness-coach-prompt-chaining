# ðŸ’ª Fitness Coach Assistant - Prompt Chaining

This project demonstrates a two-stage prompt chaining application that generates fitness plans and user-facing workout guides using the Gemini API.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal

Use Prompt Chaining to implement a two-stage assistant:

1. Chain 1 (Planning): Turn the user's fitness request into a short JSON plan that breaks the task into 3â€“6 concise steps.
2. Chain 2 (Execution): Use the JSON plan and the original request to produce a final, user-friendly fitness guide in Markdown.

## ï¿½ Features

- Two-stage prompt chaining (planning â†’ execution)
- JSON output for the plan and Markdown for the final guide
- CLI parameters for temperature, top_p, and max_tokens
- Robust JSON repair heuristics for malformed model output
- Diagnostic saving of raw responses when repair fails

## ðŸš€ Installation

1. Install dependencies

   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## ï¿½ Examples

See `examples/inputs.txt` for sample fitness prompts to try with the CLI.

## Usage

Run from the project root:

```powershell
python app.py --prompt "30-minute HIIT workout with bodyweight only" --temperature 0.7
```

## Notes

- Set your `GEMINI_API_KEY` in the environment or a `.env` file.
